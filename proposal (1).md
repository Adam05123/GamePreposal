# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

The Dreading Halls

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A horror game, where you're in a building on a mission while some entity is chasing you and the goal is to escape the building

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

It's going to be a 2D game, you'll be able to move up, down, left, and right. You'll be able to pick up collectables, mostly keys to open doors.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

My game working the way I envision it too, that means doing what I coded it to do and actually working.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think I can come up with a unique and cool "atmosphere" for the game I intend to make.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope that all the code I'm going to put into this project works the way I want it to.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I think the most important thing I'm going to have to do is research other 2D horror games to get some inspiration on what it is I want to do exactly with my project, maybe add some extra things that I might not have of thought of to give the game that extra POP.
